</pre>

<p><b>Brief</b>: <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> is a member type of the <a href="event_loop.html"><i class="code-name">event_loop</i></a>
template class. It represents an event watcher for file-descriptor readiness events; a registered
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> will receive callbacks when its associated file descriptor is
ready for reading or writing (or both, if supported by the event loop back-end). The
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> class should not be subclassed directly; the
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i> template provides a means for subclassing.</p>

<h2>Public members - fd_watcher</h2>

<h2>Details and Usage</h2>

<p>A file descriptor often represents an input or output channel (or both) for which I/O <i>readiness</i> is a
detectable event. For example, a connected network socket becomes ready for input when data is received over
the network, and ready for output when the output buffer is not full (or is below some threshold) due to
data being successfully transmitted. An <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> implementation receives
notification of readiness events on a file descriptor.</p>

<p>Some event loop backends support watching for both input and output readiness on the same file descriptor
using a single watcher (<i>epoll</i> style) and others require separate watchers for input and output (<i>kqueue</i>
style). To avoid compatibility issues it is recommended to use <i class="code-name">bidi_fd_watcher</i> rather
than <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> in order to watch for both input and output events on a single
file descriptor.</p>

<p>Note that backends do not generally support more than one watcher on the same file descriptor (or more than
one watcher for either reading or writing). Attempting to register multiple watchers for the same file
descriptor has unspecified behaviour if not supported by the backend.</p>

<h3>Subclassing fd_watcher</h3>

<p>To specify callback behaviour, <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> can be subclassed &mdash; however, it should
not be direcetly subclassed; instead, use the <i class="code-name">fd_watcher_impl</i> implementation wrapper
template.</p>

<h3>Regular files</h3>

<p>In general readiness notification for regular files is not supported by event loop backends, and arguably a
file is always ready for reading and writing (although the operation may block). However in some cases it is
convenient to treat such file descriptors as if they were connected to pipes or sockets;
<i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> by default supports emulation of readiness events for regular files,
which assumes they are always ready (though note that some backends do support regular files, and file
descriptors which are at end-of-file may be seen as not ready for reading).</p>

<h3>Listening sockets</h3>

<p>An <i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> can be used to detect incoming connections on a listening socket. New
connections will be signalled as input readiness.</p>

<p>A special problem, not specific to Dasynq, can occur when the process has reached its file descriptor
limit before a new connection arrives on a listening socket. In this case, it will be impossible to accept
the new connection and it will remain pending, causing input readiness to be reported repeatedly. There are
no solutions to this problem that are satisfactory in all cases; it is an issue inherent in the POSIX API.</p>
