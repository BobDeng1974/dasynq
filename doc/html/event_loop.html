    // generic event loop
    template &lt;typename T_Mutex&gt; class event_loop;

    // non-threadsafe event loop
    typedef event_loop&lt;null_mutex&gt; event_loop_n;

<p><b>Brief</b>: The <i class="code-name">event_loop</i> templates defines an event loop multiplexor which can be used to
listen or poll for events. A number of different types of event are handled, including I/O readiness on
file descriptors, POSIX signals, child process status changes, and timer expiry. To receive an event the
client first registers a <i>watcher</i> for the event and event source they are interested in, and then calls
the <i class="code-name">run</i> or <i class="code-name">poll</i> methods of the event loop. The <i>callback</i>
function of the watcher will be called during event processing to respond to the event.</p>

<h2>Template parameters</h2>

<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">T_Mutex</i> specifies a mutex class to be used wherever a mutex is required. The
interface should conform to that of <i class="code-name">std::mutex</i>, with <i class="code-name">lock</i>,
<i class="code-name">unlock</i> and <i class="code-name">try_lock</i> functions.
<br><i>Note:</i> it is required
that the functions of <i class="code-name">T_Mutex</i> do not throw exceptions if used properly. Technically
<i>std::mutex</i> may throw an exception if a system-level error occurs, but I do not believe this happens in
real implementations. If it does, it will cause the client application to terminate.</li>
</ul>

Additional template parameters are implementation internal.

<h2>Public members</h2>

<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">event_loop()</i> - default constructor; may throw <i class="code-name">std::bad_alloc</i>
    or <i class="code-name">std::system_error</i>. See details section.</li>

<li><i class="code-name">time_val</i> [type] - for representing time values</li>
<li><i class="code-name">mutex_t</i> [type] - alias for <i class="code-name">T_Mutex</i></li>
<li><i class="code-name">fd_watcher</i> [type] - a watcher type for watching file descriptor events</li>
<li><i class="code-name">bidi_fd_watcher</i> [type] - a watcher type for watching file descriptor events, supporting
both input and output events simultaneously</li>
<li><i class="code-name">signal_watcher</i> [type] - a watcher type for watching POSIX signal reception</li>
<li><i class="code-name">child_proc_watcher</i> [type] - a watcher type for watching child process status changes</li>
<li><i class="code-name">timer</i> [type] - a timer implementation and watcher for timer expiry</li>
<li><i class="code-name">void run() noexcept</i> - wait while there are no events pending; process pending events</li>
<li><i class="code-name">void poll() noexcept</i> - process any currently pending events</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details and usage</h2>

<p>Instances can be constructed using the default constructor. Only one instance can be active at a time in a
process; libraries that require event loop functionality are encouraged to allow an
<i class="code-name">event_loop reference</i> to be passed as a parameter from the application. Construction of
a second event loop while a first is still active has undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>Watchers for events of interest should be registered, and their callbacks will be notified when the events are
processed. Event processing occurs only during execution of the <i class="code-name">run()</i> and
<i class="code-name">poll()</i> functions.</p>

<p>Most operations involving event watchers, such as adding, removing, enabling, and disabling, are performed via
the watcher instance; consult the documentation for the various watcher types.</p>

<p>Event watchers are disabled automatically when the events they watch become pending. They must not be re-enabled
while pending. While being processed (i.e. during the execution of the corresponding watcher's callback function)
they can be re-enabled only if no other thread is processing or will process pending events until after the
callback completes.</p>

<p>Watcher callbacks can return a <i class="code-name">rearm</i> value to perform various actions, including to re-enable
the watcher in order to detect future events. Typically, if multiple threads might simultaneously call the
<i class="code-name">run()</i> or <i class="code-name">poll()</i> function, a watcher should only be enabled by
returning a suitable <i class="code-name">rearm</i> code from the handler (or at any other time only if it has never
previously been enabled).</p>

<h3>Removal of watchers</h3>

<p>Watchers can be requested to be removed from an <i class="code-name">event_loop</i>, however removal does not necessarily
occur immediately (except for non-threadsafe event loops; for threadsafe event loops, any delay is due to the watcher
currently having its callback executed). All watcher types have a <i class="code-name">watch_removed</i> function:</p>

<pre>
virtual void watch_removed() noexcept 
</pre>

<p>This function can be overridden by watch implementations and will be called once the watcher has been removed; at this
point it is safe to <i class="code-name">delete</i> the watcher. Naturally watcher instances must not end their lifetime
while they are registered to an event loop.</p>
