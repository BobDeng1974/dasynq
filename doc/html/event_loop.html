    // generic event loop
    template &lt;typename T_Mutex&gt; class event_loop;

<p><b>Brief</b>: The <i class="code-name">event_loop</i> templates defines an event loop multiplexor which can be used to
listen or poll for events. A number of different types of event are handled, including I/O readiness on
file descriptors, POSIX signals, child process status changes, and timer expiry. To receive an event the
client first registers a <i>watcher</i> for the event and event source they are interested in, and then calls
the <i class="code-name">run</i> or <i class="code-name">poll</i> methods of the event loop. The <i>callback</i>
function of the watcher will be called during event processing to respond to the event.</p>

<h2>Template parameters</h2>

<ul>
<li><i class="code-name">T_Mutex</i> specifies a mutex class to be used wherever a mutex is required. The
interface should conform to that of <i class="code-name">std::mutex</i>, with <i class="code-name">lock</i>,
<i class="code-name">unlock</i> and <i class="code-name">try_lock</i> functions.
<br><i>Note:</i> it is required
that the functions of <i class="code-name">T_Mutex</i> do not throw exceptions if used properly. Technically
<i>std::mutex</i> may throw an exception if a system-level error occurs, but I do not believe this happens in
real implementations. If it does, it will cause the client application to terminate.</li>
</ul>

Additional template parameters are implementation internal.

</ul>

<h2>Details and usage</h2>

<p>Instances can be constructed using the default constructor. Only one instance can be active at a time in a
process; libraries that require event loop functionality are encouraged to allow an
<i class="code-name">event_loop reference</i> to be passed as a parameter from the application. Construction of
a second event loop while a first is still active has undefined behaviour.
<br><b>Note</b>: This limitation is a consequence of limitations in the backends (signals require handlers to
be setup on some systems, and child process status requires watching for a signal). </p>

<p>Watchers for events of interest should be registered with the event loop, and their callbacks will be
notified when the events are processed. Event processing occurs only during execution of the
<i class="code-name">run()</i> and <i class="code-name">poll()</i> functions. Watcher callbacks can return a
<i class="code-name">rearm</i> value to perform various actions, including to re-enable the watcher in order
to detect future events.</p>

<p>Most operations involving event watchers, such as registration, removing, enabling, and disabling, are performed via
the watcher instance; consult the documentation for the various watcher types. In general, watcher operations other
than registration can not fail and will not throw exceptions.</p>

<h3>Watcher state cycle</h3>

<p>Watchers are initially in a <i>waiting</i> state once enabled.
An enabled watcher for which a watched event is detected (during the execution of the <i class="code-name">run</i>
or <i class="code-name">poll</i> functions) is disabled and becomes <i>queued</i> for notification until its callback
is run; during execution of the callback, the watcher is in the <i>processing</i> state.</p>

<p>If the event loop may be polled (via <i class="code-name">run</i> or <i class="code-name">poll</i> from another
thread while a watcher is in the <i>queued</i> or <i>processing</i> states, then the watcher must not be re-enabled
while in those states (except by returning a suitable <i class="code-name">rearm</i> code from the callback).
<br><b>Note</b>: Technically, the requirement is that polling must not be performed if an event may be detected
via an enabled watcher that is not in the <i>waiting</i> state.</p>

<h3>Event batching</h3>

Events are queued in batches before processing. Watchers can be assigned a priority value and processing of
queued events occurs in priority order. Note however that incoming events currently do not cause additional
watchers to be queued while in the processing phase.

<h3>Removal of watchers</h3>

<p>Watchers can be requested to be removed from an <i class="code-name">event_loop</i>, however removal does not necessarily
occur immediately (except for non-threadsafe event loops; for threadsafe event loops, any delay is due to the watcher
currently having its callback executed). All watcher types have a <i class="code-name">watch_removed</i> function:</p>

<pre>
virtual void watch_removed() noexcept 
</pre>

<p>This function can be overridden by watch implementations and will be called once the watcher has been removed; at this
point it is safe to <i class="code-name">delete</i> the watcher. Naturally watcher instances must not end their lifetime
while they are registered to an event loop.</p>
